The first step was initially supposed to take six weeks to implement, but it has been almost five months, and still, we haven't implemented it.\n\nWe were very excited to start working with them, expecting it to solve a lot of our current issues. However, our expectations have not been met. Despite multiple meetings with upper management and their promises to resolve issues, they have consistently failed to deliver on what was promised.\n\nWe have been with them for over five months and have not had one successful implementation of the service. I recently sent them an email requesting help and asking for timelines and expectations, and only one of the implementation specialists responded; no one from upper management did.  \n\nUnfortunately, their lack of communication and response has left me with zero confidence in their company.  I highly recommend that you use a different company.\n\nInitial Sales Representative\n\nPatrick Yoon, is very busy signing up new users but has failed to provide us as a current user any value, I feel like Yellow.AI sold us on a program that isnâ€™t fully functioning.
